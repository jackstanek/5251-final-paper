* Notes for 5251 final paper
** Lempel-Ziv algorithm
    - L_s is the maximum length of codewords, L_c is the fixed length
      of decoded symbols (i.e. ASCII, bytes, etc)
*** Encoding process
    The process of encoding is essentially taking the series of input
    words and assigning a codeword to each one.
    1. Append n - L_s zeros to the beginning of the word in the buffer.
    2.
